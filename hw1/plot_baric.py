# HW 1 Q22:
# Consider a baric equation of state of the form
# P = N kBT/V + aT^2 e^(bPV)
# for some parameters a and b. It is not generally possible to solve for the isotherms in closed form,
# expressing P as a function of V or vice versa. Write a code that (i) inputs the relevant parameter values
# and variable range; (ii) given V , numerically solves for P (at fixed T ), within some specified precision,
# and then (iii) plots the isotherms. Do not just use a pre-packaged routine to graph level curves, but
# instead try out at least two of the following standard methods: direct functional iteration, Newtonâ€™s
# method (based on Taylor expansion), or bisection.
# Show some sample output for at least two different parameter values. Try to assess which of your
# methods is most efficient for your examples, in terms of number of floating point operators required to
# converge with the same (reasonably chosen) precision
